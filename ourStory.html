	<h1> How We Met</h1>
	<p class="meet"> During Januray 2015 Michelle was going on a trip to Atlanta with a Japanese exchange student to eat at an authentic japanese restaurant. Thomas joined the conversation and so Michelle invited him out of obligation. To Michelle’s disappointment, he said he would go. Some background: Michelle had a bad impression of Thomas since she felt that he was a Wee-A-Boo because he wore a Totoro shirt to one of her classes.<br>On the way back from Atlanta, everyone else had fallen asleep and Thomas was in the passenger seat while Michelle drove. To her suprise they had quite a bit in common and talked the entire trip back. The next day Thomas asked Michelle out, only to have her say “I don’t know, maybe?” and walk upstairs to her dorm. A week later they had their first date and a month later they started dating. </p>

	<h1> Our Journey</h1>
	<p class="meet"> In 2016 Michelle and Thomas would go on to travel the United States in a cross country trip to visit her mother in San Diego. Along the way the made many stops and stopped to see the amazing sights that America has to offer. <br>In 2017 they set off for Asia for their 6 month study abroad at Nagoya University of Foreign Studies. On their way to Japan they stopped in Hong Kong and explored a new country and culture together. During their study abroad in Nagoya, Michelle was able to introduce Thomas to her bachan (grandma) before she had unfortunately passed away just a month later. </p>

	<h1> The Proposal</h1>
	<p class="meet"> On October 6, 2020 Michelle was awoken to Thomas in a suit telling her to get dressed for a suprise. Once ready they embarked on their journey where Michelle was contantly guessing what they were doing and Thomas was denying everything. To Michelle’s suprise, Thomas had called ahead and gotten Hall’s to open up early so that they could be the only ones in the restaurant to ensure a safe, socially distanced day for Michelle who is immuno deficient. <br>The proposal itself followed immediately upon arriving at their seats and almost resulted in a fall from Thomas. </p>
